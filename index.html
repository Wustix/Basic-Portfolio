    <p>My name is Wes Roehrman.  My entire life has been spent living in the state of Kansas.  Born in Dodge City, I currently live in West Shawnee on the western edge of Kansas City.  I am married with 1 step-daughter.  Some of my passions in life are the local sports teams, Kansas University, the outdoors, working on my home and rental property, and now internet development.  
    </p>

    <p>I have 2 Jack Russell Terriers name Halo and Echo.  Growing up I enjoyed participating in high school sports, with basketball being my favorite.
